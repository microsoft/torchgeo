      TorchGeo is a PyTorch domain library for _geospatial_ data. If the feature you
      are suggesting is not specific to working with geospatial data or multispectral
      satellite imagery and may be of interest to the broader computer vision
      community, consider contributing it to
      [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision) or
      [kornia](https://github.com/kornia/kornia) instead.
