# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for `main` and for the most recent minor (`X.Y`) release series of TorchGeo. Security updates will be made available as patch (`X.Y.1`, `X.Y.2`, etc.) releases.

For more on Spack's release structure, see our
[Wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo/wiki/Releasing-Instructions).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability using GitHub's private reporting feature:

1. Go to [https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo/security](https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo/security).
2. Click "Report a vulnerability" in the upper right corner of that page.
3. Fill out the form and submit your draft security advisory.

More details are available in [GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

You can expect to hear back about security issues within two days. If your security issue is accepted, we will do our best to release a fix within a week. If fixing the issue will take longer than this, we will discuss timeline options with you.
