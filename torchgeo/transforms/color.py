    There is no single agreed upon definition of grayscale for MSI. Some possibilities
    include:

    * Average of all bands: :math:`\frac{1}{C}` where :math:`C` is the number of
      spectral channels.
    * RGB-only bands: :math:`[0.299, 0.587, 0.114]` for the RGB channels, 0 for
      all other channels.
    * PCA: the first principal component across the spectral axis computed via PCA,
      minimizes redundant information.

    The weight vector you provide will be automatically rescaled to sum to 1 in order
    to avoid changing the intensity of the image.
