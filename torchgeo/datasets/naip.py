    The `National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP)
    <https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/>`_
    acquires aerial imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental
    U.S. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography
    available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.

    NAIP is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial
    Photography Field Office in Salt Lake City. This "leaf-on" imagery is used as a base
    layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the
    Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries.
