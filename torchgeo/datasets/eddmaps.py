    """Dataset for EDDMapS.

    `EDDMapS <https://www.eddmaps.org/>`__, Early Detection and Distribution Mapping
    System, is a web-based mapping system for documenting invasive species and pest
    distribution. Launched in 2005 by the Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem
    Health at the University of Georgia, it was originally designed as a tool for
    state Exotic Pest Plant Councils to develop more complete distribution data of
    invasive species. Since then, the program has expanded to include the entire US
    and Canada as well as to document certain native pest species.

    EDDMapS query results can be downloaded in CSV, KML, or Shapefile format. This
    dataset currently only supports CSV files.
