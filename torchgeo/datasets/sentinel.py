    The `Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission

    orbit, phased at 180Â° to each other. It aims at monitoring variability in land
    surface conditions, and its wide swath width (290 km) and high revisit time (10 days
    at the equator with one satellite, and 5 days with 2 satellites under cloud-free
    conditions which results in 2-3 days at mid-latitudes) will support monitoring of
    Earth's surface changes.
