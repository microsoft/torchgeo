    `Airphen <https://ideol.sakura.ne.jp/img/20170123_HiphenAirphenKeyfeatures.pdf>`__
    is a multispectral scientific camera developed by agronomists and photonics
    engineers at `Hiphen <https://www.hiphen-plant.com/>`_ to match plant measurements
    needs and constraints.

    Main characteristics:

    * 6 Synchronized global shutter sensors
    * Sensor resolution 1280 x 960 pixels
    * Data format (.tiff, 12 bit)
    * SD card storage
    * Metadata information: Exif and XMP
    * Internal or external GPS
    * Synchronization with different sensors (TIR, RGB, others)

    If you use this dataset in your research, please cite the following paper:
