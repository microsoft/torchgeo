# Discussion

# I began with a draft of what a `ForecastingGeoSampler` could look like. I am not an expert on time-series prediction so I am not completely certain what functionality one might desire from such a sampler. But I will try to explain my thoughts and the current issues I am running into.

# First of all, I am not really certain how a forecasting sampler fits in with the existing `GeoDataset` and sampler framework, since the dataset `__getitem__` method takes in a single bounding box to return a sample. There is `BatchGeoSampler` that will return a list of bounding boxes which when passed to the `batch_sampler` argument of a pytorch DataLoader will return a single batch. However for forecasting purposes we need a sequential sample consisting of multiple time steps as well as a batch size.
