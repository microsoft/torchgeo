This directory contains several files that document the versions of our dependencies used in CI. These are not hard requirements for using TorchGeo.

### Managed by dependabot

All files with a `.txt` extension are managed by dependabot and should not be manually edited unless you need to add or remove a dependency.

### Not managed by dependabot

All files with a `.old` extension are not managed by dependabot. They document the minimum version of our dependencies that we support, or older versions required for versions of Python that the numpy ecosystem no longer supports. See [NEP-29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html) for more information on the numpy deprecation timeline. See https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/5299 and https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/5300 for why these dependencies have to be in separate files with a different file extension.
