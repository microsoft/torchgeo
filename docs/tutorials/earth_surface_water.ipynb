In this case, we have to inform a CRS that is able to cope with these different regions around the globe.

Looking at list (https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html#semantic-segmentation) it is possible to note 3 models available for semantic segmentation, but one (LRASPP) is intended for mobile applications. In our tutorial, we will use the DeepLabV3 model.\n",

    "The first thing we have to pay attention in the model architecture is the number of channels expected in the first convolution (Conv2d), that is defined as 3. That’s because the model is prepared to work with RGB images. After the first convolution, the 3 channels will produce 64 channels in lower resolution, and so on. As we have now 9 channels, we will change this first processing layer to adapt correctly to our model. We can do this by replacing the first convolutional layer for a new one, by following the commands. Finally, we check a mock batch can pass through the model and provide the output with 2 channels (water / no_water) as desired."
