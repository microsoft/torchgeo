Customization
=============

Is TorchGeo missing a dataset or model you need? Would you like to modify the default augmentations for a data module or extend a builtin trainer?

The following tutorials will teach you how to customize TorchGeo to meet your needs:

* `Custom Non-Geospatial Datasets <contribute_non_geo_dataset.ipynb>`_: How to create and contribute a new NonGeoDataset
* `Custom Raster Datasets <custom_raster_dataset.ipynb>`_: How to create a new RasterDataset
* `Custom Data Module <contribute_datamodule.ipynb>`_: How to create and contribute a new DataModule

TorchGeo is a community-driven open source library. If there is a feature missing that you would like to add, please open a pull request to add it. See the ref:`contributing` guidelines to get started.
