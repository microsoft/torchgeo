    "\n",
    "Passive sensors (ones that do not emit light) are limited by daylight hours and cloud-free conditions. Active sensors such as radar emit polarized microwave pulses and measure the time it takes for the signal to reflect or scatter off of objects. This allows radar satellites to operate at night and in adverse weather conditions. The images captured by these sensors are stored as complex numbers, with a real (amplitude) and imaginary (phase) component, making it difficult to integrate them into machine learning pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Radar is commonly used in meteorology (Doppler radar) and geophysics (ground penetrating radar). By attaching a radar antenna to a moving satellite, a larger effective aperature is created, increasing the spatial resolution of the captured image. This technique is known as synthetic aperature radar (SAR), and has many common applications in geodesy, flood mapping, and glaciology. Finally, by comparing the phases of multiple SAR snapshots of a single location at different times, we can analyze minute changes in surface elevation, in a technique known as Interferometric Synthetic Aperature Radar (InSAR). Below, we see an interferogram of earthquake deformation:\n",

    "Choosing the right data for your application is often controlled by the resolution of the imagery.

    "It is not uncommon for a single sensor to capture high resolution panchromatic bands, medium resolution visible bands, and low resolution thermal bands.
