    "Open-source datasets have significantly accelerated Machine Learning Research. Within the area of Geospatial Machine Learning, the dataset can be singnificantly more complex to handle and load than more standard RGB-based Vision datasets for example. To spare the community from having to repeatly implement the logic over and over, TorchGeo supports dozens of datasets such that they can be downloaded and ready for use in a PyTorch framework within a single line of code. This tutorial will show how you can add a Non-Geospatial Dataset to this growing collection. As a reminder, TorchGeo differentiates between two dataset types: Geospatial and Non-Geospatial datasets. The difference is that Non-Geospatial datasets are integer index based datasets like the datasets one might be familar with from torchvision, while Geospatial datasets are indexed via geospatial coordinate bounding boxes. Non-geospatial datasets can still return geospatial and other metadata and should be specific to the remote-sensing domain. "

    "\n",
    "Two aspects that will make it a lot easier to add the dataset are whether or not the dataset can be easily downloaded and whether or the dataset comes with a Github repository and publication that outlines how the authors intend the dataset to be used. These are not necessariy criteria, and sometimes it might be even more worth to add a dataset without an existing code base, precisely because the marginal contribution to the community might be greater because a use of the dataset does not necessitate writing the loading implementation from scratch."

    "Once you have identified a dataset that you would like to add to TorchGeo, you could identify in what application category it might roughly fall in. For example, a segmentation dataset based on a collection of *.png* files, versus a classification dataset based on pre-defined image chips in *.tif* files. In the later case, if you find that the dataset contains *.tif* files that have very large pixel sizes, such that loading a single file might be costly, consider adding the dataset as a `Geospatial` dataset for easier indexing. Once, you have identified the \"task\" such as segmentation vs classification and the dataset format, see whether a dataset of the same or similar category exists in TorchGeo already. All datasets inherit from a `BaseClass` that provides an outline for the implementation logic as well as additional utility functions that should be reused. This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to unit test datasets.\n",
