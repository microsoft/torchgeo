    "## Defining a dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a new dataset class, we subclass from `RasterDataset`. `RasterDataset` has several class attributes used to customize how to find and load files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `filename_glob`\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to search for files that belong in a dataset, we need to know what the filenames look like. In our Sentinel-2 example, all files start with a capital `T` and end with `_10m.tif`. We also want to make sure that the glob only finds a single file for each scene, so we'll include `B02` in the glob. If you've never used Unix globs before, see Python's [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) module for documentation on allowed characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `filename_regex`\n",
    "\n",
    "Rasterio can read the geospatial bounding box of each file, but it can't read the timestamp. In order to determine the timestamp of the file, we'll define a `filename_regex` with a group labeled \"date\". If your files don't have a timestamp in the filename, you can skip this step. If you've never used regular expressions before, see Python's [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) module for documentation on allowed characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `date_format`\n",
    "\n",
    "The timestamp can come in many formats. In our example, we have the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 4 digit year (`%Y`)\n",
    "* 2 digit month (`%m`)\n",
    "* 2 digit day (`%d`)\n",
    "* the letter T\n",
    "* 2 digit hour (`%H`)\n",
    "* 2 digit minute (`%M`)\n",
    "* 2 digit second (`%S`)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll define the `date_format` variable using [datetime format codes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### `is_image`\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data only contains model inputs (such as images), use `is_image = True`. If your data only contains ground truth model outputs (such as segmentation masks), use `is_image = False` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the sample returned by the dataset/data loader will use the \"image\" key if *is_image* is True, otherwise it will use the \"mask\" key.\n",
    "\n",
    "For datasets with both model inputs and outputs, the recommended approach is to use 2 `RasterDataset` instances and combine them using an `IntersectionDataset`. See L7 Irish, L8 Biome, and I/O Bench for examples of this in `torchgeo/datasets`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `dtype`\n",
    "\n",
    "Defaults to float32 for `is_image == True` and long for `is_image == False`. This is what you want for 99% of datasets, but can be overridden for tasks like pixel-wise regression (where the target mask should be float32).\n",
    "\n",
    "### `resampling`\n",
    "\n",
    "Defaults to bilinear for float Tensors and nearest for int Tensors. Can be overridden for custom resampling algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `separate_files`\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data comes with each spectral band in a separate files, as is the case with Sentinel-2, use `separate_files = True`. If all spectral bands are stored in a single file, use `separate_files = False` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `all_bands`\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data is a multispectral image, you can define a list of all band names using the `all_bands` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `rgb_bands`\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data is a multispectral image, you can define which bands correspond to the red, green, and blue channels. In the case of Sentinel-2, this corresponds to B04, B03, and B02, in that order.\n",
