Case Studies
============

The following case studies present end-to-end workflows for common use cases of geospatial machine learning:

* `Earth Surface Water <earth_surface_water.ipynb>`_: A workflow for mapping surface water, including lakes and rivers
* `Land Cover <land_cover.ipynb>`_: An end-to-end workflow for mapping land cover using `VectorDataset` and Sentinel-2, includes data curation, training, evaluation, and inference

Do you have a use case that is missing from this list? Please open a pull request to add tutorials for your own use cases.
