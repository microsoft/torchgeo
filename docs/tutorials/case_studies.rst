Case Studies
============

The following case studies present end-to-end workflows for common use cases of geospatial machine learning:

* `Earth Surface Water <earth_surface_water.ipynb>`_: A workflow for mapping surface water, including lakes and rivers
* `Earthquake Detection <earthquake_detection.ipynb>`_: A workflow for change detection to detect areas affected by earthquakes

Do you have a use case that is missing from this list? Please open a pull request to add tutorials for your own use cases.
