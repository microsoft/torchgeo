Getting Started
===============

New to deep learning or remote sensing? First time using PyTorch or TorchGeo? You've come to the right place.

The following tutorials will teach you enough to get started:

* `Introduction to PyTorch <pytorch.ipynb>`_: A brief overview of deep learning with PyTorch
* `Introduction to Geospatial Data <geospatial.ipynb>`_: A brief overview of the challenges of working with geospatial data
* `Introduction to TorchGeo <torchgeo.ipynb>`_: A brief overview of the design of TorchGeo
