    "TorchGeo provides Lightning `DataModules` and trainers to faciliate easy and scalabel model training based on simple configuration files. Essentially, a `DataModule` implements the logic for splitting a dataset into train, validation and test splits for reproducability, wrapping them in PyTorch `DataLoaders` and apply augmentations to batches of data. This tutorial will outline a guide to adding a new datamodule to TorchGeo. It is often easy to do so alongside a new dataset and will make the dataset directly useable for a Lightning training and evaluation pipeline"
