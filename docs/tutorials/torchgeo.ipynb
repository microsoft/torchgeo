    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a common task in geospatial machine learning to motivate us: land cover mapping. Imagine you have a collection of imagery and a land cover layer or *mask* you would like to learn to predict. In machine learning, this pixelwise classification process is referred to as *semantic segmentation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "More concretely, imagine you would like to combine a set of Landsat 7 and 8 scenes with the Cropland Data Layer (CDL). This presents a number of challenges for a typical machine learning pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We may have hundreds of partially overlapping Landsat images that need to be mosaiced together\n",
    "* We have a single CDL mask covering the entire continental US\n",
    "* Neither the Landsat input or CDL output will have the same geospatial bounds\n",
    "* Landsat is multispectral, and may have a different resolution for each spectral band\n",
    "* Landsat 7 and 8 have a different number of spectral bands\n",
    "* Landsat and CDL may have a differerent CRS\n",
    "* Every single Landsat file may be in a different CRS (e.g., multiple UTM zones)\n",
    "* We may have multiple years of input and output data, and need to ensure matching time spans\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't have a dataset of length 1, and it isn't obvious what to do when the number, bounds, and size of input images differ from the output masks. Furthermore, each image is far too large to pass to a neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, people either performed classification on a single pixel at a time or curated their own benchmark dataset. This works fine for training, but isn't really useful for inference. What we would really like to be able to do is sample small pixel-aligned pairs of input images and output masks from the region of overlap between both datasets. This exact situation is illustrated in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Landsat CDL intersection]()\n",

    "Now, let's see what features TorchGeo has to support this kind of use case."
